      <h1 class="sky-blue">AI:</h1>
      <p>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, speech recognition, and visual perception. AI is transforming industries, automating processes, and enabling machines to think and act like humans.

Historically, the concept of AI dates back to the 1950s, when researchers began developing computer systems that could perform simple tasks. In the 1970s and 1980s, the first practical applications of AI emerged, such as control systems for factories and expert systems.

In the 1990s, new technologies emerged in the field of AI, such as machine learning and neural networks. These technologies enabled the development of more complex systems that could perform tasks more accurately.

Today, AI is an integral part of our daily lives, and we use it in applications such as voice assistants, facial recognition, and self-driving cars.

      <h1 class="sky-blue">Textual Models of AI (GPT) :</h1>
      <p>
Textual AI models, such as GPT, analyze vast amounts of data to generate meaningful text outputs. These models power chatbots, content generation tools, and assistive technologies, making communication more seamless and intuitive.

Historically, the concept of textual AI models dates back to the early 21st century, when researchers began developing computer systems that could analyze text data. In 2015, the first GPT models were developed, which were capable of generating meaningful text.

Today, GPT models are used in applications such as conversations, content generation, and assistive technologies. These models enable machines to perform tasks more accurately and quickly, making communication more seamless and intuitive.

      <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; background-color: #555555; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid #FFFFFF; border-radius: 15px;">#Oss GPT v.3 is a bot program similar to artificial intelligence. While most of its commands are in English, its data is in Arabic. It is capable of evolving and responding based on its database rules. It can calculate, understand, extract meanings, and assist you through the command `?help`. If asked or input a word it doesn't know, it will ask you to teach it, thus growing and learning through user interaction. It can display its data using the command `data`, delete it entirely or partially, and can be taught synonyms and antonyms as well. With future development, it will be able to accomplish many functions.

This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence department at Fluxa AI under B.Y PRO Software Company.</p>
